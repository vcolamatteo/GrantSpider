Certificate on the Financial Statements (CFS)

The CFS is a report produced by an independent auditor (or, for public bodies, public officer) using the template available on Portal Reference Documents. Its purpose is to give assurance to the Granting Authority about the regularity of the costs claimed.

The thresholds depend on the EU programme and type of action (see call conditions on the Topic page). For the MFF 2021-2027, there is usually a single threshold of EUR 325 000 requested EU contribution.

4\ Please note that costs already audited by the Granting Authority do not have to be covered again by the CFS (the EU contribution covered by the audit can therefore be excluded from the calculation of the threshold).

The CFS must be uploaded as a scanned copy (PDF) together with the Financial Statement. The originals must be kept in the your files.
