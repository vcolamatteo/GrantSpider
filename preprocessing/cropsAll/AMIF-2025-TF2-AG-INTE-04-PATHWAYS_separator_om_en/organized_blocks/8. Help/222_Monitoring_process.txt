Monitoring process

 • Review meeting and assessment - experts read all relevant documents before and attends the review meeting. They then assess the project on the basis of the written material and information provided at the meeting. In the event of remote monitoring, the assessment is based on written documents only.

 • Monitoring report - the expert draws up the monitoring report on a project, and the EU service sends it to the consortium via the Coordinator, but it is not made public. If more than one expert is involved in project monitoring, they issue a single consolidated report written by a rapporteur.

 • Recommendations - the monitor will also assist the EU services by recommending any changes that may be required. However, the final decision on recommendations and changes is taken by the EU services alone.

 • Observations - Beneficiaries may comment on the monitoring report within one month of receiving it.

 • Project assessment by the EU services? - taking the experts’ formal recommendations into account, the EU services informs the Coordinator of its decision, which, however, may depart from the recommendations. It may entail

o accepting or rejecting the deliverables o allowing the project to continue in its existing form o suggesting modifications, or o taking steps to terminate the Grant Agreement or to exclude a Beneficiary from taking part.
