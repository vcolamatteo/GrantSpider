3.1.3 Apply with partners or as individual

Who can apply?

To see whether your organisation is eligible for funding, check the call conditions on the Topic page.

In general, most EU funding programmes require that participants (Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities) are:

 • legal entities (public or private bodies, including international organisations)

and  • established in one of the eligible countries, i.e.: o EU Member State (including EU overseas countries and territories (OCTs)) o eligible non-EU countries: o EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway — if opted-in for the programme) o associated countries (countries associated to the funding programme by paying a contribution — /ist differs for each programme).

4\ Please be aware, however, that almost all programmes have additional criteria, which widen or narrow the group of entities that can apply. Some programmes are open to participants from the entire world (e.g. Horizon Europe) others are deliberately restricted to EU countries only (e.g. EDF). In addition, the situation can be different from call to call even within a programme. It is therefore very important to carefully look at the call conditions.

Moreover, participants must be registered in the Participant Register (mandatory for Beneficiaries, Affiliated Entities and Associated Partners) and be validated by the Central

Validation Service by the time the grant is signed (mandatory for Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities).
