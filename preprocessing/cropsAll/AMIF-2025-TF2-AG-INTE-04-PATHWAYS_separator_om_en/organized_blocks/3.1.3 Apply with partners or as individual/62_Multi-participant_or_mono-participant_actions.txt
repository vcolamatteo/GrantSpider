Multi-participant or mono-participant actions

Most of the calls for EU grants target multi-beneficiary consortia made up of participants from different countries — to enhance the EU added value, promote cooperation between organisations in different countries, reinforce the quality of applications and ensure fair competition and equal opportunities throughout the EU.

Some programmes formalise this, by adding specific requirements for the consortium composition (e.g. Horizon Europe, UCPM, etc).

To see whether a call requires minimum consortium composition, check the call conditions on the Topic page.

How to find partners for your project ideas?

To find partners for your project ideas, you can:

 • Use the Partner Search function of the Portal. The function allows to:

o look for organisations which received funding in the past

o create and check Partner Search requests by call/topic

 • Use other Partner Search tools and services. A list of recommended support sites is offered under the Helpdesks & Support Services page.

 • Participate in conferences, brokerage events organised by the EU or networks in the Member States (National Contact Points or Desks, Enterprise Europe Network, etc).
