2.5 Bank account registration and validation

Reaistration and validation of the bank account for payments

In addition to the validation of the participating organisations, we also have to validate the bank account that will be used for our payments to you (usually bank account of the Coordinator).

The Central Validation Service will contact the Coordinator after the PIC is validated, to enter the bank account details into the Participant Register and upload the necessary supporting documents (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation).

The documents required will be listed in the notification you receive. In general, you will need to provide the bank account details and either a bank statement or financial identification form.

The Central Validation Service will cross-check this information and validate the account.When registering your organisation for the first time, you do not need to declare any bank account information. You will be prompted to do this only later on, if your proposal is successful.
