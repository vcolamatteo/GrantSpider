5.1.5 Complaints about failed submission

If you think that submission of your proposal failed and this was due to a technical error on the Portal side, you may lodge a complaint through the IT Helpdesk.

The complaint must be filed within 4 calendar days after call closure. You will receive an acknowledgement of receipt the same or next working day.

What else to do? You should secure a PDF version of the part B and annexes of your application holding a time stamp before the call deadline (file attributes listing the date and time of creation and last modification), as well as proof of the alleged failure (screenshots). You may be requested by the IT Helpdesk to provide these items.

EC services will check the IT logs (application log files and access log files of the Commission IT systems involved) and see if they show a technical problem on the Portal side which prevented you from submitting (or resubmitting) the proposal.

You will be notified about the outcome as soon as possible.

If your complaint is justified, the files you provided to the IT Helpdesk will be used as your proposal and sent for evaluation. If you didn’t provide any files, the last version recorded in the IT system will be used.
