Withdrawal of submitted proposals

Before the call deadline, a proposal can be withdrawn at Step 6 of the wizard (My Proposals > View Submitted > Withdraw proposal). After the call deadline, withdrawal has to be requested via the IT Helpdesk.

Once withdrawn, the new status will be shown on the My Proposals page (and you can delete the application with the Delete button).
