Project Legal Signatory (PLSIGN)

The PLSIGN has the right to sign the grant/contract (and amendments) for a specific project on behalf of the organisation.

The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint LSIGNs; the Coordinator and each participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PLSIGNs for a given project to act as legal signatory for the participant in the project.

An organisation can have can have an unlimited number PLSIGNs per project.

They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot assign/revoke any roles.
