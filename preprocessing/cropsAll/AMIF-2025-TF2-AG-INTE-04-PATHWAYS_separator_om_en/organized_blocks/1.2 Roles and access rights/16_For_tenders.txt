For tenders:

The tender will contain the following types of participating organisations:

 • Group Leader. A submission can have only one, and you may submit a tender with just one Group Leader and no more participating organisations.  • Group Member. A submission can have none, one or more (often none).

In a call for tenders, you need to provide one single contact: Contact Point. One per application. This Contact is always linked to the Group Leader.

During the submission phase, this is the only role which will be defined. The Contact Point will then become the Primary Coordinator Contact (PCoCo).
