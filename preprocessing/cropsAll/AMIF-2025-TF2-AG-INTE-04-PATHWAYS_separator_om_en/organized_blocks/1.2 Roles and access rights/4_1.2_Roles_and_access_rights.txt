1.2 Roles and access rights

Roles and access rights restrict the information a user can view and the tasks they can perform (for instance, only a person with the coordinator role can delete a draft application).

Access rights are linked to a user's roles in the Portal personalised area (My Area), which are in turn linked to their functions within their organisation or in relation to a particular project/contract and their nomination by the organisationâ€™s LEAR (or other authorised person).
