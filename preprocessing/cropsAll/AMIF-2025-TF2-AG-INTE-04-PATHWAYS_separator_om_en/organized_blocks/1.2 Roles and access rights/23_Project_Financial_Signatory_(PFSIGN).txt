Project Financial Signatory (PFSIGN)

The PFSIGN has the right to sign cost claims/invoices on behalf of the organisation.

The LEAR (or Account Administrators) must first appoint FSIGNs; the Coordinator and each participant (PCoCo/CoCos/PaCos) can then assign PFSIGNs for a given project to act as legal signatory for the participant in the project.

An organisation can have an unlimited number of PFSIGNs per project.

They have the same rights as CoCos/PaCos for project/contract information. Cannot assign/revoke any roles.
