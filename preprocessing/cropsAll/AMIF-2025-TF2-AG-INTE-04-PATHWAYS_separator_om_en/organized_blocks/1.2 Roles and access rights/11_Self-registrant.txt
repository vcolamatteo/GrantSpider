Self-registrant

The Self-registrant is the person who first registers an organisation in the Portal Participant Register.

Before the LEAR is validated, Self-registrants can provide the EU with requested information and documents about their organisation.

Once the LEAR has been formally validated (normally after the organisation has been validated by the Central Validation Service), the role of Self-registrant is revoked and replaced by the LEAR.
