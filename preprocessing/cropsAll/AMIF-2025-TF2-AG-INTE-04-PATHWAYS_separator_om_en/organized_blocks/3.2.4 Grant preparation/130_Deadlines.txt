Deadlines

In the interest of all sides, we will try to handle grant preparation as swiftly as possible (ideally 3 months after you receive the GAP invitation letter).

To make this happen, we will ask you to comply with relatively strict deadlines during grant preparation:

 • Preparation grant data & annexes (first version): 3 weeks after GAP invitation letter

 • Finalisation grant data & annexes: up to 2 weeks after reply by Project Officer

 • Sign declaration of honour (DoH): at the latest 6 weeks after GAP invitation letter.

 • Grant signature: 3 months from GAP invitation letter

Deadlines can be extended under exceptional circumstances by the EU Project Officer.

4\ Please note that if you have not been granted an extension, and fail to meet the established deadlines, preparation of your Grant Agreement may be terminated and your proposal rejected.
