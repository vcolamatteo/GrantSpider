Monitoring projects (Technical review)

Projects are monitored to assess the work carried out over a given period and make recommendations to the EU services. Monitoring may cover scientific, technological and other aspects of the implementation of the project and Grant Agreement.

The monitoring expert's task is to advise the EU services on how the project has progressed with regard to:

 • the initial work plan  • deliverables  • planned and used resources  • relevance of the objectives  • scientific and industrial quality  • management procedures and methods  • Beneficiaries' contributions, and  • the expected potential impact in scientific, technological, economic, competitive and social terms, and the plans for the use and dissemination of results.

Depending on the project's complexity and progress, the review may include remote work entailing reading and analysis of the Grant Agreement, grant decision and other background information and deliverables and finally drafting the report. The expert may also be required to attend project meetings at the EU services offices or at the premises of the Beneficiary.

The EU services may require the expert to carry out on-site technical audits to verify whether critical milestones are being met, or to assist in carrying out research integrity (scientific misconduct) analysis during implementation.
