& Grant agreement ready for signature

The system prepares the Grant Agreement for signing (PDF document, digitally sealed to guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).

Coordinator signs the Grant Agreement

The Coordinator's PLSIGN logs into the Portal My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Sign.

During signature, a pop-up explains that this means the signatory is preparing to sign. It then asks the PLSIGN to confirm that they wish to sign and a second prompt asks the PLSIGN to enter their EU Login password.

After signature, the system creates a new version of the PDF document (with a digital seal, a time stamp, and the signatory's EU Login credentials on the signature placeholder). The validity of the signature can be verified by opening it in a compatible PDF reader and clicking on the image of the digital signature.

The Grant Agreement can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature) from the Documents screen if desired.

The LEAR of the Coordinator and the other Beneficiaries are informed that the Coordinator has signed the Grant Agreement.
