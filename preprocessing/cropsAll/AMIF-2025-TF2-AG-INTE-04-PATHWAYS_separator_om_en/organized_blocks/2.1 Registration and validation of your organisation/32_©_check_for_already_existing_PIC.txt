© check for already existing PIC

In order to avoid creating duplicate PICs, you should first check whether your organisation (or another department) is already registered in the Portal and use that PIC.

Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Search a PIC > Search a PIC and put in your organisation data. 4\ Check several variants to make sure there is really no entry.

|f no PIC is registered, start registration

Go to How to Participate > Participant Register > Register your organisation. The Registration wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process.

Detailed explanations are available in the S47 ~—.

You do not need to complete the registration process in a single session. You can enter some information, save it and continue later on. To resume your registration, go to My Organisations > Continue Registration. Incomplete draft registrations are automatically deleted after one year.

If you create by mistake a new PIC, see below Data updates.
