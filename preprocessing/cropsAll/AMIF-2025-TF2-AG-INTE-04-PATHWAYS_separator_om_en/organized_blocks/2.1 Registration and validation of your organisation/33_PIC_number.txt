PIC number

After completing a new registration, you will receive the 9-digit Participant Identification Code (PIC) â€” to be used in your online application form and further correspondence with the EU services.

The newly created PIC will be provisional (declared/non-valid status) until it is formally validated at a later stage.

Nothing else is expected from you after the PIC has been generated, the Central Validation Service will contact you later, to initiate the validation process.
