CVs (if required)

Provide CVs for the core project team (these are the key staff you have listed in part B and may include outside experts, if key to your proposal).

You can submit CVs in any format. If standard CVs are required in the call conditions we strongly recommend you to use the Europass format. If short outlines are requested, there are no specific formatting requirements (but please keep the information on each person to name, birthdate and 1-2 paragraphs describing studies and most relevant work experience).

As far as possible, upload them in a single PDF file, rather than individually.

If you are still recruiting, please provide the job profile.

Activity report of last year (if required)

This report should describe your organisation's activities for the last year.

It should be detailed enough to allow us to check your organisation’s aims and activities and its operational and professional capacity.

No finalised annual report yet? Submit the draft version, certified by your organisation's legal representative.

No report of this type available? Create one for this application and have it certified by your legal representative.

Online versions — If your report is available on your website, you can just provide a link (directly to the document(s), not simply to the homepage) and indicate the link on a separate sheet and upload it as annex (PDF format).
