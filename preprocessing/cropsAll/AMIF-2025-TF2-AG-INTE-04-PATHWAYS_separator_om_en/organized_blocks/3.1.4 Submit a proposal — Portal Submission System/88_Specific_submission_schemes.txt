Specific submission schemes

Two-stage submission schemes — You must submit a short outline proposal for stage 1 and will be invited to submit a full application only if you pass to stage 2. The full application must be consistent with the short outline proposal (no substantial differences allowed).

Calls with multiple cut-off dates — The call has a final closure date (usually the end of the funding programme) and several cut-off dates that trigger evaluation. There is an evaluation session after each cut-off date and the final closure date (normally within a month). After each cut-off date, the submitted proposals are grouped, reviewed and ranked together. Evaluation results are made available and proposals invited for grant preparation. If you miss a cut-off date, the proposal will be evaluated with the next batch in the next evaluation session.
