Tips

Do not wait until the end to submit

It is highly recommended to submit your proposalas early as possible and at least 48 hours before the deadline. This will avoid technical problems (system requirements, local configuration settings, system congestion, etc).

4\ Please note that you can submit the proposal as many times as you want. Every submitted version will replace the previous one. Your proposal is sealed and closed. It will not be accessed before the deadline of the call. There is no reason to delay submission for fear of disclosure.
