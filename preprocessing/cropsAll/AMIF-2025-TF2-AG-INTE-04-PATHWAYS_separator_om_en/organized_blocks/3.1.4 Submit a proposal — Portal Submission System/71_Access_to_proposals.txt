Access to proposals

The proposals will remain sealed and closed until after the call deadline.

However, in order to plan the evaluation process (organise translations, evaluation capacities, evaluators with specialist knowledge, etc) we will ask you for permission to access to certain information already before:

 • call title and topic for which the proposal is submitted

 • title of your application, proposal abstract, keywords

 • PICs of the participating organisations

 • relevant panel (for proposals submitted to specific panels, e.g. Horizon Europe MSCA, UCPM).

GNA warning will inform you that the Granting Authority will be accessing this information and will give you the opportunity to refuse access.
