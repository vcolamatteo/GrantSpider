Security, data protection and document retention

Your proposal and all the information received from you will be stored under secure conditions at all times. The Portal is a closed, secured platform with multiple safeguards.

After the evaluation, we will keep the proposals for audit trail purposes (at least 5 years for unsuccessful proposals and 10 years after project end for successful proposals and, possibly, longer if needed for controls, checks and audit purposes).

Personal data will be handled according to the standards set out in Regulation No 2018/1725 and in line with the Portal Privacy Statement.

4\ Please be aware that your proposal MUST NOT contain any classified information (Decision 2015/444 or national rules).
