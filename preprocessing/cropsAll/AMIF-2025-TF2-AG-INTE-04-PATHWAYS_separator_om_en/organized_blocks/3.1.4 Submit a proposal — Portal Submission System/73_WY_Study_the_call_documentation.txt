WY Study the call documentation

Choose your topic, and then read carefully the related documents and standard templates that are available on the Topic page.

4\ The Submission System will check some basic admissibility and eligibility requirements, but NOT all of them. It is therefore very important that you carefully read the call conditions. Please note that whenever there is a contradiction between the IT checks in place and the call documentation, the call documentation prevails.

& Select your partners for the project

Most calls require several participants in the proposal (see call conditions on the Topic page).

You can use the Portal Partner Search to find partners. Other partner search tools are explained in the Helpdesk & Support Services page.

â€˜Plan your project and prepare the Technical Description (Part B)

Planning of the work (work packages, deliverables, milestones)

Look at the call conditions, award criteria and standard application form (Technical Description (Part B)) on the Topic page.

For most types of action the Technical Description must give a detailed description of the project idea and work plan (work packages, milestones and deliverables, division of responsibilities and resources, time schedule, project management _ structure, dissemination and communication activities).
