1. Distinguish between milestones and deliverables:

— milestones: control points in the project that help to chart progress (kick- off meetings, steering committes, first-draft of a survey, prototype, etc) — deliverables: outputs to be submitted to the EU (publication, leaflet, progress report, brochure, list, etc)

2. Be as specific as possible, e.g.:

— events — the number of events, title, content, duration, number of participants, etc. — publications — number of pages, language, format (printed/electronic), number of printed copies (in each language), etc.

3. Be realistic about what you can achieve within the project duration. The scope of your project should be large enough to make a difference, but it doesn't need to produce an excessively high number of outputs.

4. Refer only to major outputs. Do NOT include minor sub-items, internal working papers, meeting minutes, etc. Adapt the number of deliverables to the size of your

project and work packages (use as many as necessary, as few as possible). You may be asked to reduce or increase the number during grant preparation.
