4.2.2 Evaluation

Admissible and eligible proposals are sent on to evaluation by an independent evaluation committee.

For most programmes the evaluation committee (panel) is made up of EU staff from the Granting Authority and other services. They are often and assisted by outside experts for individual evaluation and consensus group evaluation. For some programmes however (e.g. Horizon Europe), the committee is usually composed exclusively of outside experts â€” for all stages of the evaluation process (no internal staff).

The evaluation committee will also take position on the operational capacity of the consortium and individual participants to properly implement the tasks planned. This assessment will be based on the competence and experience of the participants, including operational resources (human, technical and other) and is, for many programmes, integrated into the award criteria.
