Consensus group

After the individual evaluation, all evaluators who have evaluated the proposal will get together in a consensus group, to agree on a common position on comments and scores.

For consensus groups made up of outside experts, the group will normally be assisted by a member of the Granting Authority staff who will act as moderator to:

 • seek a consensus, impartially and

 • ensure that each proposal is evaluated fairly, according to the award criteria.
