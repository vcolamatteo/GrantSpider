Eligibility criteria

The eligibility criteria are also set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.

The basic eligibility check involves for most EU programmes if the content of the proposal is in line with the topic description and if it involves participants coming from the right countries.

Additional criteria depend on the programme or specific topic (i.e. minimum consortium composition, type of participant, geographic location of the project activities, coordinator from an EU country, etc.).

For more information on participation of non-EU participants, see Who can apply section.
