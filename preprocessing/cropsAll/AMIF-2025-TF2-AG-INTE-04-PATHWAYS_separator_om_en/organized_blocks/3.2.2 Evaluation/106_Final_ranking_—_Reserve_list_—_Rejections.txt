Final ranking — Reserve list — Rejections

The Granting Authority produces the final ranked list and the list of applications proposed for funding.

The number of proposals in the list depends on the available budget. If the available budget is too small to fund all above-threshold proposals (normally the case because EU grants are heavily oversubscribed), some proposals may be put on a reserve list. These will then be offered funding if a higher-scoring project does not go ahead or additional funds become available.

The below-threshold proposals will be rejected.

a Proposals will NOT be offered funding if the Granting Authority finds that it is already funding very similar work elsewhere, or a proposal is in any way manifestly contrary to EU general principles or established EU priorities or policies.
