Outcome of the admissibility and eligibility check

If a proposal is inadmissible or ineligible, the participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) and the rejection letter will be posted in their Portal library (My Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Documents).

For complaints procedures against such rejections, see section Complaints about proposal rejection.
