Interviews/hearings

If provided for in the call conditions, the evaluation committee (panel) may arrange interviews /hearings.

In this case, invitations are sent to the coordinators of above-threshold proposals (and, sometimes, also to those with scores above individual thresholds but below the overall qualifying threshold).

The interviews/hearings may be held remotely or on site, in Brussels.

The questions to be asked will be determined by the panel beforehand and sent to all proposals. The interviews/hearings will be used to get further information to clarify the proposals and help the panel establish its final ranking list and scores. They may not serve to change proposals or add missing information.

On the basis of the report and ranked list provided by the evaluation committee (panel), the Granting Authority reviews the evaluation result, puts together the final ranking list and informs the participants.

You can find the timing the evaluation and information on evaluation results in the call conditions on the Topic page.
