Individual evaluation

During the individual evaluation, the evaluators work individually. Each evaluator gives a score for each criterion, with explanatory comments, and prepares an individual evaluation report (IER).

Proposals are normally evaluated by at least three individual evaluators (for some programmes and types of action, two may suffice; for many it is five).

The evaluators should also indicate if they consider that the proposal:

 • is out of scope or  • involves security issues that will need further scrutiny.
