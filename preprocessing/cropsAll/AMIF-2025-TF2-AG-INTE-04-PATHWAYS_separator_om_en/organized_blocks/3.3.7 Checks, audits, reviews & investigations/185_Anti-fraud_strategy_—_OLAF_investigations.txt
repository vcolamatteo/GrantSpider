Anti-fraud strategy â€” OLAF investigations

In case of fraud suspicions, the Granting Authority will inform the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF), who may conduct more in-depth investigations.

OLAF also cooperates with national authorities (through information exchange, on-the-spot checks, coordination of forensic audits etc).
