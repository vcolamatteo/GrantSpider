Conflicts of interest

When contracting independent experts, the EU services ensure — to the best of their knowledge - that you, as an expert, do not have any conflicts of interest on the activity that you are being asked to undertake and, in particular, any proposal or project you are called upon to assess.

You should be independent, impartial and objective, and behave professionally at all times.

The contract you sign before starting work includes a declaration that you accept and will abide by the Code of Conduct (Annex 1 of the contract). This means, amongst other things, that

 • you declare that no conflict of interest exists and

 • you will inform the EU service concerned if you should discover that any such conflict arises in the course of your duties.

 • If, at the time that you sign the contract, you are already aware that you may be ina position of conflict of interest, you are required to declare this.
