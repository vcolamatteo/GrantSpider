Confidentiality

If your role involves handling classified information, you will need security clearance before entering into a contract.

The EU publishes an annual list of experts who have worked for us but we do not disclose who has worked on which proposals.

Before assigning a project to you for monitoring activities, the EU services may inform the project consortium of your name. The consortium may reject our choice of expert in the interests of commercial confidentiality.

Requests for payment

Once your work is completed, you will receive an e-mail inviting you to submit your request for payment through My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal.

Travel expenses — When you claim your travel expenses, you should upload scanned copies of all the original supporting documents as requested. You must keep records and other supporting documents for at least two years after the payment is made to show that you have complied in full with the terms of your contract.

Deadline — You should submit your request for payment within 30 days of receiving the email invitation.

Bank account — You should request payment on one of the bank accounts which you have listed in My Expert Area.

The EU services will make payments within 30 days of receiving the reports, deliverables or completed payment requests (whichever comes latest) provided they are complete and approved
