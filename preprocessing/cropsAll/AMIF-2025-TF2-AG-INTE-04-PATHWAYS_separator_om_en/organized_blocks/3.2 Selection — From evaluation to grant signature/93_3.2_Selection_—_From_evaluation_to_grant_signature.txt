3.2 Selection — From evaluation to grant signature

3.2.1 Admissibility and eligibility check

Once you have submitted a proposal, the Granting Authority will check:

 • admissibility (complete and properly put together) and

 • = eligibility (fulfills eligibility conditions)

and then

 • ask an independent evaluation committee to evaluate it.
