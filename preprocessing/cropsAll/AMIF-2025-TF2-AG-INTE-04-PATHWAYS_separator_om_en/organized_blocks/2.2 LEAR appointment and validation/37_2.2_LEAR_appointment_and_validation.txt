2.2 LEAR appointment and validation

Parallel to the validation of your organisation, you will be requested by the Central Validation Service to appoint your Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR).

This must be done by a legal representative of your organisation with the necessary legal authority to commit the organisation for this type of decisions (e.g. typically CEOs, rectors, Director-Generals, etc... always in accordance with the statutes of your organisation). 4\ If such decisions are normally reserved for joint decision-making by several representatives, the appointment must be done together (documents signed by all).

The LEAR role, which can be performed by any member of the organisation (typically from the central administration), is key. They are formally nominated to manage your organisation’s use of the Portal and thus bear the final responsibilty for all your actions in the Portal. Once validated, they will be responsible for:

 • keeping an overview of all the proposals/projects/contracts your organisation is involved in

 • managing all the legal and financial information about your organisation

 • managing the access rights at organisation-level (and read-only access at project-level)

 • appointing the persons which will be able to electronically sign grants/contracts (Legal Signatories — LSIGNs) and cost claims/invoices (Financial Signatories — FSIGNs).

Applicants that are natural persons do not need to prove their capacity to become a LEAR, but still need to enter their LEAR data and submit supporting documents.

Further details about the LEAR's rights and responsibilities are explained in the Roles and access rights section.

Appointing and validation of your LEAR

4) Please note that registration and validation of your organisation is a prerequisite for the validation of your LEAR.

© Identify the person in your organisation who will act as LEAR and the legal representative who will appoint them

The person who initially registered the organisation in the Participant Register (the Self- registrant) will receive the notification from the Central Validation Service to launch the LEAR appointment procedure.

& Encode in the Participant Register the name and contact information of the LEAR and the legal representative appointing them

To do so, the Self-registrant must go to My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation.

The Participant Register will, then, generate the necessary documents to be signed:

 • LEAR appointment letter and LEAR role and duties (generated as a single document)  • declaration of consent to the Portal Terms & Conditions.

The system will automatically check the existence of an EU Login account for the LEAR (e- mail address, first and last name). In case of inconsistencies, the system alerts the Self- registrant. If no EU Login account exists, the system will start creating one and the LEAR will be requested (via a notification e-mail) to finalise it. The LEAR appointment process will be blocked until this is done.

Get your organisation's legal representative to:

 • date, sign and stamp the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR roles and duties document generated by the system (4h both sections must be signed)  • read the Portal Terms and Conditions and  • date, sign and stamp the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions.

Upload the following documents in the Participant Register:

 • the LEAR appointment letter & LEAR role and duties (dated and signed by the legal representative and the LEAR)  • the declaration of consent to the Portal Terms and Conditions (dated and signed by the legal representative)  • copies of an official valid proof of identity (ID-card, passport) with a photo and signature of: o the legal representative and o the appointed LEAR  • documents proving the authority of the legal representative; these documents must: o Clearly indicate the person’s role/function within the organisation as legal representative o identify and appoint the individual (by name) as the person covering that specific role/function.

4‘ Don't forget that you MUST keep the originals of all documents you uploaded, so that they are available in case of EU controls, checks or audits. Since your registration in the Participant Register is valid for this and any future EU funding and tenders procedures your organisation will ever apply for, the originals must be kept permanently, as long as you are registered in the Portal (and possibly beyond, for controls, checks and audits, etc). You should therefore NOT throw them away and ensure that they are maintained also in case of insolvency, takeover or change of control.

Validation of the LEAR appointment by the Central Validation Service

After receiving the above-listed documents and once the corresponding PIC has been validated, the Central Validation Service will also validate the LEAR appointment in the Participant Register.
