Actions to be completed before amendment

WY Make sure new participants are registered and validated (PIC)

New Beneficiaries and Affiliated Entities must be registered and validated in the Participant Register before the amendment can be requested (see section on Registration and validation of your organisation).

Associated Partners need to be only registered (have a PIC); no validation is needed, because they will not receive any grant money from us.

& Make sure that new bank accounts are registered and validated

New banking information must be registered and validated in the Participant Register before an amendment can be requested (see section on Bank account registration and validation).
