5.3.2 Amendments

If there are any changes to the Grant Agreement (e.g. data or options specific to that agreement) or its annexes, they must be done through a formal amendment directly in the Portal (electronic signature).

Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Launch new interaction with the EU > Request for Amendment.

Who? Amendments can be prepared by the consortium participants together, but only the Coordinator can launch, sign and submit them.

The EU Granting Authority can also propose amendments, but for practical reasons we will often as you to initiate the procedure.

When? Amendments must normally be done before the end of the project, but some amendment clauses are also open afterwards (addition of Beneficiary/Affiliated Entity/Associated Partner, change of Coordinator, change of Annex 1, change of Annex 2, change of bank account, error amendments, etc).

What? Cases requiring a formal amendment are listed in the AGA — Annotated Grant HOW TO Agreement, art 39. See also How to prepare an amendment in the @) 5
