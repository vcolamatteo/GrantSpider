5.5 Grant management

3.5.1 Keeping records

All participants must keep records and other supporting documentation in order to prove the proper implementation and the costs claimed (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 20).

For Lump Sum grants, records on costs incurred are exceptionally NOT needed; it is enough to keep the evidence to prove the proper implementation of the action.
