Entry into force & taking effect

An amendment proposed by a consortium enters into force on the day the Granting Authority signs it.

It takes effect (i.e. the changes to the Grant Agreement start to apply) either:

 • ona specific date specified in the amendment or

 • on the date of entry into force (last signature = signature by the EU).

a Depending on the nature of the amendment, the date on which it takes effect may affect the eligibility of costs (e.g. if a Beneficiary is added, costs are eligible from the accession date specified in the Accession Form).
