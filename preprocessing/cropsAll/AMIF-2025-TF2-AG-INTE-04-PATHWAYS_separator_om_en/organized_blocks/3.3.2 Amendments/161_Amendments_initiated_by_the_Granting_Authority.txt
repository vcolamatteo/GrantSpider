Amendments initiated by the Granting Authority

If the Granting Authority requests an amendment, the request is also prepared and signed electronically in the Portal Grant Management System.

You will receive an e-mail notification prompting you to accept the request.

To do so, the Coordinator's PLSIGN must countersign the amendment on the consortium's behalf.
