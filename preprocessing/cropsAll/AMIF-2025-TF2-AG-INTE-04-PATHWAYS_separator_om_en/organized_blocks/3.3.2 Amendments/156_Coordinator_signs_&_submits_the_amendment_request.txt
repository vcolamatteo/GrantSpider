Coordinator signs & submits the amendment request

Once the request for an amendment is complete and ready to be submitted, the system generates the 2 documents (amendment request letter and amendment core) for signature (PDF document, digitally signed to guarantee its security, reliability and authenticity).

The Coordinator’s PLSIGN logs into My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Amendment > Sign & Submit (Same procedure as for Grant Agreement; see Signing the Grant Agreement).

The amendment can be previewed, downloaded or printed (before or after signature) from the Documents screen if desired.

G\ As Coordinator, you cannot alter a request for an amendment once it has been signed and submitted. There are 2 options:

 • You withdraw it.

 • The Granting Authority rejects it (amendment rejection letter).
