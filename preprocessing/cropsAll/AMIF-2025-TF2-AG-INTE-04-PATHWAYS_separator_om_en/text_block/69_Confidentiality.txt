Confidentiality

EU services will treat your proposal confidentially, as well as any related information, data and documents received.

Our evaluators (both in-house and outside experts, if any) are also bound by an obligation of confidentiality.

4\ Please do NOT discuss your proposal with persons that might act as expert evaluator for us or be otherwise involved in the evaluation, since this could lead to a conflict of interest with adverse consequences both for you and the concerned person.
