After submission

At submission, the application package is combined into one document, sealed and an e-receipt is generated (with date and time of submission).

All contact persons of the coordinating organisation will receive an e-mail (after each submission if several). 4\ If you have not received this e-mail, the application has not been submitted. Please try again or contact the IT Helpdesk.

After the submission, there is normally no further contact between you and us until after the end of the evaluation. The competent EU service will contact you only if there is a need to clarify issues or request additional information or if the call foresees a hearing/interview as part of the evaluation procedure.
