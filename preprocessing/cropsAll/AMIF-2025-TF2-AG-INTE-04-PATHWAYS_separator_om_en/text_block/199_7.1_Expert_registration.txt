7.1 Expert registration

Registering as an expert

To work as expert, you will first need to register.

To register, go to the Experts’ page on the Funding & Tenders Portal. To access the registration forms, you'll need an EU Login account, which you can set-up on the same website if you don't yet have one.

Once you've done this, you can log in to your account any time and view, update or complete your profile in “My Expert Area”.

Click on the "Register as an expert" button. To create your profile, you'll need to specify:

 • personal details, knowledge of languages, education and training

 • area of expertise

 • professional experience (employment, past involvement in EU research programmes, publications or other achievements...)

To find out exactly what type of knowledge and skills we are looking for, see the call for expression of interests.
