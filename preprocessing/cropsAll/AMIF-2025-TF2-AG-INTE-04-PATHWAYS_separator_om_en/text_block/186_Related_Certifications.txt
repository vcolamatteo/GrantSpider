Certificate on the methodology for unit cost (COMUC)

The CoMUC is a factual report produced by an independent auditor (using the template available on Portal Reference Documents). Its purpose is to enable the granting authority to:

 • identify your usual cost accounting practices

 • check that you have used a suitable unit cost accounting methodology.

Submitting a COMUC methodology certificate is voluntary. Doing so will help prevent problems later on, if your grant is audited. If the certificate is approved, costs declared in line with this methodology will not be challenged, unless you have concealed information for the purpose of the approval.

For the MFF 2021-2027, only CEF and Digital Europe will be using this certification. For Horizon Europe it has been replaced by the SPA (systems and process audit; see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art 24).

The certificate may be requested at any time during the implementation of the programme.

As a minimum, one project should have been started and the data available must give the auditor enough of a basis to carry out the necessary procedures. Ideally, we would recommend submitting the methodology after at least one reporting period has passed.

In case of subsequent changes to your methodology you should notify the Granting Authority. You may also submit a new certificate reflecting the changes.
