After the call deadline

Once the call deadline has passed, no further corrections or re-submissions are possible. However, you can have read-only access to the submitted proposal (My Proposals > View Submitted).

Proposals that were never submitted (remain in draft status) are accessible for 90 days after the call deadline (My Proposals > View Draft).
