Signing the contract

You must sign the contract online in My Expert Area on the Funding & Tenders Portal. You will receive an email notification inviting you to do so, with a link to the contract. The contract enters into force only once it has been signed by both parties. The contract must be signed by both yourself and the EU service concerned by the day on which you start working as an expert. Please do not forget to obtain permission from your employer to carry out your expert activities if your employer requires this for outside activities - this is your responsibility. You may start work as soon as_ the’ contract has entered’ into force. If you have a contract to act as an evaluator or monitor, you will be granted access to the IT system for the relevant proposals or project reports once the contract has entered into force.
