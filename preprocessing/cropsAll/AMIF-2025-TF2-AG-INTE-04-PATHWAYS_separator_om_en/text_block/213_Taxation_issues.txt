Taxation issues

You are obliged to ensure compliance with your national legislation on taxes and social security law — this is your responsibility. Payments you receive are NOT exempted from national taxes.

However, if you are considered to supply a taxable service under national tax law and you are registered for VAT as a natural person in an EU Member State, you can benefit from a VAT exemption certificate for EU payments made under your contract.

+) Please note that in this case your invoice needs to bear a special indication "VAT exemption / European Union / Article 151 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC” (specific incidations are mandatory for some countries, /ike Belgium, Luxembourg or Italy).

Further information on the VAT situation can be found in the FAQs on the Funding & Tenders Portal.
