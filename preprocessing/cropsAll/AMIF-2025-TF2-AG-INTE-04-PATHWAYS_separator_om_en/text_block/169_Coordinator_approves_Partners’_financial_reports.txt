Coordinator approves Partnersâ€™ financial reports

The Coordinator must review and explicitly approve the periodic report. If needed, you can send back a Financial Statement to a Partner for further changes, or unlock the Technical Report for editing.

Before submitting, all the accepted Partners' Financial Statements must be included (My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Periodic Reporting > Include).
