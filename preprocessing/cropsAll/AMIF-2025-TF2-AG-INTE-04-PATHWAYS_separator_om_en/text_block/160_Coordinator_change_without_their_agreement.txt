Coordinator change without their agreement

If the Coordinator is to be replaced without their agreement, another Beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other Beneficiaries in the consortium) must submit the amendment request.

To do this, you will need to contact the EU Project Officer, so that they can give you (exceptional) PCoCo access rights in the system.

4\ Please note you will have to provide proof both of the consortium decision to change the Coordinator, to nominate you to act on their behalf AND the opinion of the changed Coordinator (or at least proof that the opinion was requested) â€” otherwise the termination will be considered improper.
