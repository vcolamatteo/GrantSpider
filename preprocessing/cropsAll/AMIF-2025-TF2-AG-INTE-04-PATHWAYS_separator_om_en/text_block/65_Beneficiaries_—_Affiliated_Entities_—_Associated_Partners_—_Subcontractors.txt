Beneficiaries — Affiliated Entities — Associated Partners — Subcontractors

The roles should be attributed according to the level of participation in the project. Main participants should participate as Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities (former Linked Third Parties); other entities can participate as Associated Partners, Subcontractors, Third parties giving in-kind contributions, etc.

Associated Partners and Third parties giving in-kind contributions do not get any part of the grant money and will therefore have to organise other funding sources (bear their own costs, internal reallocation of funding inside the consortium, find investors, etc).

4\ Subcontracting should normally constitute a limited part of the project and will need to be justified (give reasons). Tasks may NOT be subcontracted inside the consortium (between Beneficiaries or Affiliated Entities).
