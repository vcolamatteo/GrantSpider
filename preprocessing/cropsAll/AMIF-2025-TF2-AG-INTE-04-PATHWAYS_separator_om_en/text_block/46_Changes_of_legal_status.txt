Changes of legal status

If your organisation changes status or address, your LEAR should immediately update the information in the Participant Register (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation) and, if possible, directly inform (via your Coordinator) your EU Project Officers in ongoing grants (Coordinator uses the Portal Messaging Facility: My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Process communications > New message).

Some changes like, for instance, partial or universal transfers of rights will moreover require amendments in case you have ongoing Grant Agreements/Procurement Contracts.
