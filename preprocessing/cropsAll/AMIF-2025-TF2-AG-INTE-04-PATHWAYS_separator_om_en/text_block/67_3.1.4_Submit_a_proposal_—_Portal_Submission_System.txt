3.1.4 Submit a proposal â€” Portal Submission System

Proposal submission

Proposals must be submitted electronically using the Portal Submission System.

Where? Access to the Submission System is available through the Topic page on the Portal> Start Submission.

Who? Proposals must be created and submitted by a contact person of the coordinating organisation. Exceptions exist for some programmes/types of action which are fully focused on individuals (e.g. the Principal Investigator in Horizon Europe ERC grants or the Fellow in Horizon Europe MSCA grants).

How? The Submission wizard will guide you step-by-step through the process. You will need to use the online forms and templates available in the Submission System. The application form is described below.
