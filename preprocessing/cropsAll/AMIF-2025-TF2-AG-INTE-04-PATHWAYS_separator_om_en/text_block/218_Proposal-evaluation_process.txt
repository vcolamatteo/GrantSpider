Proposal-evaluation process

The underlying principles to bear in mind during evaluation are:

 • Excellence - projects must demonstrate a high level of quality in relation to the topics and criteria set out in the calls

 • Transparency - funding decisions must be based on clearly defined rules and procedures, and applicants should receive adequate feedback on the outcome of the evaluation

 • Fairness and impartiality - all proposals must be treated equally and evaluated impartially on their merits, irrespective of their origin or the identity of the applicants

 • Confidentiality - all proposals and related data, knowledge and documents must be treated in confidence

 • Speed and efficiency - proposals should be evaluated and grants awarded and administered as swiftly as possible, without compromising quality or breaking the rules
