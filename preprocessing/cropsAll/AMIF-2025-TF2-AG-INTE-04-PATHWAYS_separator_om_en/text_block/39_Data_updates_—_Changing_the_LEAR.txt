Data updates â€” Changing the LEAR

If you need to replace an already validated LEAR, you can designate a new LEAR by making a new appointment (same steps as initial appointment).

If you are a LEAR and your e-mail address has changed, please inform the Central Validation Service via the Portal Messaging Facility (My Organisations > Actions > Modify Organisation), in order to obtain instructions on how to proceed for the change.
