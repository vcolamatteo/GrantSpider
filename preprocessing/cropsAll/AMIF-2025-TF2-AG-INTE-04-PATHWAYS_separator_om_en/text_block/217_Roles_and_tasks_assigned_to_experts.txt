Roles and tasks assigned to experts

As an expert, you can perform a variety of roles and tasks:

1. Evaluators are responsible for evaluating proposals submitted in response to a call for proposals. Evaluators may also act as a rapporteur, chair, or vice-chair at consensus discussions or meetings of panels of evaluators. Rapporteurs are responsible for drafting the consensus report (CR) of a consensus meeting.

2. Observers provide the EU services with independent advice on the conduct and fairness of all phases of the evaluation process, on how evaluators apply award criteria, and on how to improve the procedure. The observer may attend any meeting held during the proposal evaluation process and drafts a report on the evaluation session observed.

3. Monitors assist EU services in monitoring the implementation of projects that have received funding, taking into account work descriptions, reports and deliverables.

All experts' tasks are laid down in their contract and its annexes. See the Model Contract for Experts for further details.
