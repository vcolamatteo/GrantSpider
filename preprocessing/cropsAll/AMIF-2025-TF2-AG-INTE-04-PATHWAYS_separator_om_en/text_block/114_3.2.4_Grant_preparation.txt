3.2.4 Grant preparation

Grant preparation

The Grant Agreement must be prepared directly in the Portal Grant Management System.

Where? Access to the Grant Management System is available through My Projects > Actions > Manage Project > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Grant agreement data preparation.

Who? The Grant Agreement data should be prepared by the consortium participants together and submitted by the Coordinator.

How? You will be prompted by e-mail for all the actions that you need to carry out for the grant preparation. For more details, see the /ist of grant-related notifications.

What? The grant preparation process consists of:

 • setting up the Portal Grant Management System with the: o participants’ legal, administrative and financial information o description of the action (DoA, Annex 1 GA) o estimated budget (Annex 2 and 2a GA) o project variables (when the project starts, reporting periods, amount of prefinancing, GA options, etc)

 • setting up the Portal Grant Management System with the:

o project variables (when the project starts, reporting periods, amount of prefinancing, GA options, etc)

o legal documents needed for grant signature (declarations of honour)

 • so that the system can generate the Grant Agreement

and

 • trigger signature directly inside the system (Grant Agreement and Accession Forms).

In parallel, the Granting Authority will perform the remaining legal checks to ensure that all the successful proposals can receive EU funding (legal entity validation, financial capacity check, non-exclusion check, etc).

4S Our Grant Agreement clauses are common to all EU programmes and mandatory for all beneficiaries. They are explained in more detail in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.
