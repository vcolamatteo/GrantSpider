What does communication involve?

The communication activities must already be part of the proposal (either as a specific work package for communication or by including them in another work package). Communication will be taken into consideration as part of the award criteria.

A good communication plan should define clear objectives (adapted to various relevant target audiences) and set out a description and timing for each activity.

With your communication activities you should draw the attention (general and specialised audiences) to the EU policy area addressed by the call.

Regarding typical communication activities (and indicators to measure them), you can refer to the communication network indicators we use for our own communication activities.

In addition, some programmes (e.g. Horizon Europe) may have more targeted communication guidance (see Horizon Europe Programme Guide).
