Budget

Look at the budget table in the Administrative Forms (Part A) in the Submission System. Only the white cells need to be filled in (the grey cells are not applicable or automatically filled by the system).

Cross-check with Part B to see if you will also need to submit a detailed budget table or outline budgetary details also in Part B.

The budget categories to be used for the call are set out in the call conditions and explained in the AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement.

The budgeted costs should be based on a detailed and accurate estimation of your estimated project costs (based on the cost eligibility rules set out in the Grant Agreement). They should include a// your estimated costs (those of your Affiliated Entities should be presented separately, for each participating entity).

Keep your estimates on file — you may be required to produce them later on.
