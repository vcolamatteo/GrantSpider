YW Payment

When the Granting Authority approves the payment, the amount due will be paid out to the Coordinator (within 90 days of receiving the report)

If the amount due is above the interim payment ceiling (90% of the maximum grant amount), the amount due will be lowered.

The Granting Authority will send a letter to inform about the payment. After receiving the letter, the Coordinator has 30 days to submit observations, if needed. In case of observations, the Granting Authority will send a confirmation letter to state its final position.
