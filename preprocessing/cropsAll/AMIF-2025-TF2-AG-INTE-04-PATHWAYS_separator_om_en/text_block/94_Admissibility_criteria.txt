Admissibility criteria

The admissibility conditions are set out in the call conditions on the Topic page.

They are generally the same across all EU programmes. The proposal must:

 • be submitted through the online Submission System before the call deadline  • be complete — application form correctly filled out, all sections of Parts A and B completed, all annexes and supporting documents provided  • bereadable, accessible and printable.

Furthermore, the proposal should respect the page limit set out in the application form. Excess pages will be automatically made illegible, and will not be taken into consideration by the evaluators.
