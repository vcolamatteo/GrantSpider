How can you contact the LEAR?

For contacting LEARs of other organisations, go to How to participate > Participant Register > Search a PIC to find the organisation. Then, select Actions > Contact Organisation. This will launch a contact form that allows you to send a message to the LEAR (and their Account Administrators). The LEAR can then contact you directly.

To contact your own LEAR, log in and then go to My Organisations > Actions > Contact Organisation.
