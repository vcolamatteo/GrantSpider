Submission process

Get prepared: Finding your topic > Find partners > Plan your work and budget

Proposals are submitted using the application forms available in the Submission System. The application form is structured in into two parts, Parts A and B:

 • Part A: contains the structured Administrative Forms with data on the participants, legal declarations and contact persons (retrieved from the Submission System screens). It may also include some programme-specific questions.  • Part B (the narrative part): Technical Description of the project with the planned activities, work packages, costs, etc (must be uploaded as PDF).

Part A is generated while entering the data into the Submission System; Part B needs to be prepared in advance (using the template downloaded from the system; do NOT use the standard template from the Topic page).

Part B will also include annexes and supporting documents if required by the call conditions (detailed budget table, declarations from national authorities, CVs, annual activity reports, etc).

aS All participants can contribute to the parts, but it is the person from the coordinating organisation who created the application who must finalise and submit the application.

For programmes with specific security requirements, special instructions may apply (e.g. for EDF, documents must be uploaded through a password-word protected zip file). For such programmes, detailed instructions will be available in the call documentation.

Tasks of the Coordinator:

 • Mandate: Make sure that you have the mandate of all participants to submit the application (explicit agreement to participate).

 • Mandate: Make sure that you have the mandate of all participants to submit the application (explicit agreement to participate).  • = Quality check: Check that the application is coherent and that Part A and B are consistent (especially budgetary information).
