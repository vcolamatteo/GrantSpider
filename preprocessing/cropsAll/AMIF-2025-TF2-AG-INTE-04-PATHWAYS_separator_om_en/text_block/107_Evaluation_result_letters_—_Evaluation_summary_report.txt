Evaluation result letters — Evaluation summary report

The participants will be informed (through the coordinating organisation) about their evaluation result (together with the evaluation summary report (ESR)) and it will be posted in their Portal library (My Proposals > Actions > Follow-up > Proposal Management & Grant Preparation > Documents).

4\ Please note that invitation to grant preparation is NOT a formal commitment for funding. The final decision on your project will only be taken at a later stage — this depends on the finalisation of grant preparation and further checks which we still need to make (i.e. financial capacity, non- exclusion, etc).

If your proposal was not succesful, you will receive a rejection letter. The means of redress for such rejections are described in the section Complaints about proposal rejection.
