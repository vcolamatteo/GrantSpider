Briefing of evaluators

Before starting the evaluation process, the evaluators are briefed on:

 • the evaluation processes and procedures (including award criteria)

 • the content of the topics under consideration

 • the need to evaluate proposals as they were submitted, rather than their potential should certain changes be made

 • for outside experts: the terms of their contract (confidentiality, impartiality, conflicts of interest, completing tasks and approving reports, penalties for non-compliance, etc).

4\ For most EU programmes, there is no scope for recommending improvements to proposals (including improvements on the budget).
