Good communication

 • Starts at the outset of the action and continues throughout its entire lifetime  • Is strategically planned and not just ad-hoc efforts  • Identifies and sets clear communication objectives (e.g. have final and intermediate communication aims been specified? what impact is intended? what reaction or change is expected from the target audience?)  • Is targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project's own community, including the media and the public  • Chooses relevant messages (e.g. how does the action's work relate to our everyday lives? why does the target audience need to know about the action?)  • Uses the right medium and means (e.g. working at the right level — local, regional, national, EU-wide; using the right ways to communicate — one-way exchange (website, press release, brochure, etc) or two-way exchange (exhibition, school visit, internet debate, et.); where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues related to the action)  • Is proportionate to the scale of the action.
