Deadline models

Single-stage

For most topics, you must submit a full proposal by the call deadline.

Two-stage

Some topics have a 2-stage submission procedure, which means that you have to submit a short outline proposal for stage 1 and then a full proposal only if you are invited to stage 2 (meaning that your project looks promising).

Multiple cut-off

Some topics are continuously open, where you can submit a proposal at any time, and cut- off dates mean that all proposals received by a given cut-off date will be evaluated after that deadline.
