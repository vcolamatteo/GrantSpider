Coordinator â€” Other Beneficiaries

The Coordinator is responsible for managing the project, submitting reports and deliverables and acting as intermediary for all contacts with the EU Granting Authority.

The other Beneficiaries must implement their part of the project and contribute to the grant administration (preparing the grant, reporting, etc).

The consortium participants will be jointly responsible for implementing the project activities (in accordance with their proposal/description of the action). If a project is not finished (or badly implemented), the grant money may have to be reduced for everyone.
