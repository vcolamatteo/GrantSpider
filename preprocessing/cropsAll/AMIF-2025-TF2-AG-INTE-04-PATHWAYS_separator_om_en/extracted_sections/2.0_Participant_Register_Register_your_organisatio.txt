2. Participant Register — Register your organisation
If you want to submit a proposal, your organisation needs to be registered in the Portal
Participant Register and have a 9-digit Participant Identification Code (PIC).
If your proposal is successful, you will receive a notification and be asked to:
• provide supporting documents to confirm the administrative and legal information
declared during the registration (legal entity validation)
• appoint a Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR appointment)
• provide supporting documents to verify the financial capacity of your organisation
(financial capacity assessment, if applicable)
• validate the bank account for payments (bank account validation, only for coordinators).
