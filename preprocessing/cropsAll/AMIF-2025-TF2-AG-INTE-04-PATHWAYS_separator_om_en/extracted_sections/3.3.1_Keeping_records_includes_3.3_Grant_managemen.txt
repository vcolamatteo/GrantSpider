3.3 Grant management

3.3.1 Keeping records
All participants must keep records and other supporting documentation in order to prove
the proper implementation and the costs claimed (see AGA — Annotated Grant Agreement, art
20).
For Lump Sum grants, records on costs incurred are exceptionally NOT needed; it is enough to
keep the evidence to prove the proper implementation of the action.
