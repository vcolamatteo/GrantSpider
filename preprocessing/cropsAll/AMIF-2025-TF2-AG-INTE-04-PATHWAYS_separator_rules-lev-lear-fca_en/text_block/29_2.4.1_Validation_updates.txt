2.4.1 Validation updates

In case of a change in the participant’s legal situation (identity/legal form, name, address, status, etc), the participant must request an update of the validation.

Requests to update a validation will be accepted, if submitted by the participant’s LEAR and accompanied by the relevant supporting documents. 4S If no LEAR has been appointed yet in the Participant Register, requests for modification should be submitted after the LEAR appointment has been validated.

The ‘effective date of the change’ will be the date on which the act establishing the change enters into force (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).

For SMEs and mid-caps, the effective date is the closure date of the accounting period on which the change of status is based. For cases of mergers and acquisitions that lead to the loss of the SME or mid-cap status, the effective date of change will be the date when the ownership structure changed.

The impact and practical consequences of the changes depend on each funding programme.
