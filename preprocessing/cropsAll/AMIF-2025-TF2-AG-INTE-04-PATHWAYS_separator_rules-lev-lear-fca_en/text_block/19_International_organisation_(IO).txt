International organisation (IO)

‘International organisation’ means an intergovernmental organisation (other than the EU) established under international public law, including specialised entities — with or without legal personality — set up by international organisations.

This status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.

For some EU funding programmes there are moreover specific subtypes of international organisations:

— ‘international organisations of European interest for H2020 (H2020 IOEI)’, i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member States or H2020 associated countries and whose main objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe — ‘international European research organisations for Horizon Europe (HE IERO)’, i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries and whose main objective is promoting scientific and technological cooperation in Europe — ‘international organisations of European interest for Digital Europe (DEP IOEI)’, i.e. international organisations with a majority of members that are EU Member States or whose headquarters are in an EU Member State.

The H2020 IOEI subtype status is systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.

The HE IERO and DEP IOEI subtype statuses are self-declared. In the future, for calls where the HE IERO and DEP IOEI statuses have an impact on eligibility or funding, participants will also be asked to go through a self-assessment wizard.
