2.1.4 Specific legal statuses

In addition, the validation covers the following specific legal statuses that are used in certain EU funding programmes:

— private entity or public body — non-profit or for profit organisation — small or medium sized enterprise (SME) — middle-capitalisation enterprise (mid-cap) — non-governmental organisation (NGO) — civil society organisation (CSO) — international organisation (IO) — research organisation — secondary or higher education establishment.

An entity may be categorised in more than one of these legal statuses (i.e. non-profit, public body, research organisation, international organisation, etc.).

The practical relevance of these statuses (and what happens if they change) is established at the level of the different funding programmes, and sometimes even at the level of the call for proposals/call for tender.

Moreover, not all of these statuses are systematically checked and validated by the Central Validation Service. Some of them are self-declarations or self-assessments. This means that the participants are solely responsible for the correctness of the information they provide (in the self-declaration/self-assessment).

The Central Validation Service may however — at any time — carry out checks on self-declared/self-assessed statuses against supporting documents and ask for clarifications.

4S In case of false declarations, the EU services may:

— withdraw and correct the validated status(es) — terminate/withdraw on-going grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc (and recover any undue amounts) — impose financial penalties or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc.; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation) — inform the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
