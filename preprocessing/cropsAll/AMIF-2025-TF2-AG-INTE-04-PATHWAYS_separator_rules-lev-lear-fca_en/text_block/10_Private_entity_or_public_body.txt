Private entity or public body

‘Private entity’ means an entity established under private law.

‘Public body’ means an entity established as a public body by national law, or an

international organisation.

‘Established as a public body by national law’ means:

— incorporated as a public body in the act of creation or recognised as a public body by national law and — governed by public law (— both conditions must be fulfilled).

Criteria such as:

— mission or activity in the general interest (public service mission) — the fact that the shares are owned by a public body (even if ownership reaches up to 100% of the share capital) — public financing — state supervision and control

do NOT constitute sufficient evidence to qualify an entity as a public body, if the above two conditions are not met.

Public bodies may however act and be subject to private law for some or most of their activities, provided that, concerning their existence and their functioning, they are subject to public law.

The two statuses (private entity and public body) are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only be validated as one or the other.

They are systematically checked against supporting documents and validated by the Central Validation Service.

Specific cases

«* Self-employed persons (persons who perform an activity independently and with their own means, such as craftsmen and individuals exercising liberal, industrial and commercial professions) — Are regarded as ‘natural persons’, not as ‘private entities’; the business/profession/activity they perform is not provided with independent legal personality different from that of the person.

“ Private law bodies with a public service mission? — A legal entity incorporated under private law/private legal form is not considered to be a public body even if owned by the State/other public bodies and/or pursuing a public service mission.
