Civil society organisation (CSO)

‘Civil society organisations’ are organisations from the ‘third sector’ of society, distinct from government and business (i.e. private for profit entities).

This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will normally be accepted only by private entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
