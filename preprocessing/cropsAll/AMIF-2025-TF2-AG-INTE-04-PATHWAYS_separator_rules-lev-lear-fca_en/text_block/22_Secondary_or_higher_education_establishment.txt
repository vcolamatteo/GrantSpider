Secondary or higher education establishment

‘Secondary or higher education establishment’ means an entity that is recognised as such by its national education system and is able to deliver diplomas recognised by the State.

It can be a public body or a private entity (see above). The national accreditation as a secondary/higher education establishment is not sufficient to consider the entity as a public body.

This status is self-declared.
