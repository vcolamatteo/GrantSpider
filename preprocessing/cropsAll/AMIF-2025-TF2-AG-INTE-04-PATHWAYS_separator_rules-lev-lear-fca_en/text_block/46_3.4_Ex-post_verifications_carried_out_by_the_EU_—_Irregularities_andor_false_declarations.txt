3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false declarations

The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews, audits or investigations.

If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.

If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.

In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).

In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
