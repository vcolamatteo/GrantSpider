2.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false declarations

The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews, audits or investigations.

If they find out that a participant did not meet the criteria for being validated or for being validated with a specific legal status (e.g. due to false declarations), the modification of the validation will be registered with retroactive effect back to the effective date of the validation.

If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc, their participation may be terminated/withdrawn and undue amounts paid will be recovered.

In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).

In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
