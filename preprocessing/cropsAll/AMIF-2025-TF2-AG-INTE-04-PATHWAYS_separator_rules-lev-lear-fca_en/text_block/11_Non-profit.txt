Non-profit

‘Non-profit entity’ means an entity that is non-profit making by its legal form or legal purpose (e.g. charitable organisations), or that has a legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to its shareholders or members.

All profits have to be reinvested in the same activity of the entity.

Decisions on (not) distributing profits made by the managing board, associates, stakeholders, members, or representatives and/or practices adopted by the entity to not distribute profits and/or the absence of profits achieved are not sufficient proof of the non-profit nature. The obligation not to distribute profits and/or the impossibility to distribute profits must be based on law and/or the act of establishment/articles of association/statutes, etc.

Whether the owners/founders of the entity are non-profit and whether the profits are allocated to non-profit (or for profit) entities is irrelevant.
