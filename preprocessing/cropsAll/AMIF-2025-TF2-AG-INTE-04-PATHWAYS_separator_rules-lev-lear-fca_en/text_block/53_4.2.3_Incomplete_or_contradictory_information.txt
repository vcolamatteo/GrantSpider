4.2.3 Incomplete or contradictory information

The Central Validation Service may use any publicly available information to clarify questions about (and complement) the data or information provided by the participants.

Participants may be required to confirm or explain the information submitted or publicly available, or provide missing information within a reasonable time, if:

-— findings do not match their declarations or statements — the documents submitted are outdated — the provided information is illegible, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory or unclear.

es If participants do not respond in time, the Central Validation Service has the right to refuse the assessment (or finalise it on the basis of the information and documents submitted or publicly available).

If the financial documents do not contain sufficient information regarding the nature and the maturity of the current assets, provisions and liabilities, and such information is not provided, the financial assessment will be completed by taking the most prudent approach, e.g. by considering the maturity of the current assets to be after one year, and of the provisions and liabilities to be within one year.
