2.3 Validation and effective date

On the basis of the submitted information and documents, the participant will be validated with the effective date of entry into force of the legal act establishing its constitution or incorporation (unless the terms of the act stipulate another date).

That date will be, in order of precedence:

1. the date of registration in the country'sâ€™official registry (e.g. commercial registry) 2. the date of publication in the national official journal 3. the date of the legal deposit of the act in the court registry 4. the date of signature of the parties.

When there is no act of constitution or incorporation, the participant will be considered to exist since a standard default date.

The effective date for the SME and mid-cap status will be the accounts closure date of the accounting period on which the assessment is based in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Annex of the SME Recommendation 2003/361. For newly established enterprises that do not yet have closed accounts, the effective date is the date of their creation.

The effective date of other specific legal statuses is the date in which the specific status enters into force. This date may be the same as its effective date of constitution or incorporation (or may differ, if the specific status has been acquired later on).
