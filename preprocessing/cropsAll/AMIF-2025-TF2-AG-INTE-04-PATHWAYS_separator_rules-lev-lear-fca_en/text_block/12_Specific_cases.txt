Specific cases

« Public bodies — Are in principle regarded as non-profit by default.

« Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) — The classification as ‘non- governmental organisation (NGO)’ is not relevant for the non-profit status, since in most countries NGO is not a recognized legal form. By contrast, non-profit status is a prerequisite for the self-declaration as NGO (see below).
