Research organisation

‘Research organisation’ means an entity that:

— is established as non-profit organisation as described above and — carries out research and/or technological development as its main objective.

The following are NOT considered research activities:

— supporting or financing research activities carried out by other entities — promoting, managing or coordinating research activities.

Only entities that have research and/or development as their main objective can qualify as research organisations. By contrast, entities that have research and/or development as ancillary activities (even if regular and substantial, e.g. in museums or hospitals) do not qualify as ‘research organisations’.

This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
