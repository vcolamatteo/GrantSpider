Non-governmental organisation (NGO)

‘Non-governmental organisations’ are organisations which are voluntary, independent from government and non-profit, and which are not a political party or trade union.

This status is self-declared. Self-declarations will be accepted only by private entities, which have been validated as ‘non-profit’.
