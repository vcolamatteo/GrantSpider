Middle-capitalisation enterprise (Mid-cap)

'Middle-capitalisation enterprise’ means an enterprise that is:

— not a micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprise (SME) under the EU SME Recommendation 2003/361

and

— employing up to 3 000 persons® , where the headcount of staff, including all relevant direct and indirect partner and linked enterprises, is calculated in accordance with Article 3 to 6 of the Annex to the Recommendation.

This status is self-declared. For calls where the mid-cap status has an impact on eligibility or funding (higher funding rate, etc.), participants must go through the SME

self-assessment wizard to make sure that they do not fall under the definition of SME, and then to self-declare that the number of employees does not exceed 3 000 persons.
