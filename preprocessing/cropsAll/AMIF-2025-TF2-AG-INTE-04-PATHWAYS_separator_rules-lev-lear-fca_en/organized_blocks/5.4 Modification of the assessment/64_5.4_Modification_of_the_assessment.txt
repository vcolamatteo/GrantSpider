5.4 Modification of the assessment

Changes in the ownership control status need to be communicated to the granting authority/contracting authority, which will trigger a new assessment by the Central Validation Service, if needed.

For more information on the ownership control assessment procedure, see the Guidance on participation in DEP, HE, EDF and CEF-DIG restricted calls*.
