4.4 Modification of the assessment

In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).

The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the additional documents.
