Proof of identity

‘Identity documents’ are those issued by national authorities and recognized by national law as valid proof of identity. Identity documents can not be replaced by any other means of proof. The EU services cannot waive this requirement under any circumstances.

Examples of identity documents accepted are ID cards and passports. Driving licenses are also accepted, as long as they are considered as valid proof of identity under the applicable national law of the entity concerned.

Identity documents must be valid (not expired) at the time of the LEAR appointment.

An integral copy of the document must be provided (e.g. in most countries both sides of the identity card must be provided).

Identity documents in which some parts/elements, including the photo, have been deleted/erased/covered (e.g. with black marker) cannot be accepted.
