4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false declarations

The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews, audits or investigations.

If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be changed.

If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.

In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).

In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
