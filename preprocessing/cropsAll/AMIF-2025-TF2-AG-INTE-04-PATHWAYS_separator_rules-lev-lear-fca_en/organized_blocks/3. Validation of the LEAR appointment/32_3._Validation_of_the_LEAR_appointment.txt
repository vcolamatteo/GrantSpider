3. Validation of the LEAR appointment

3.1 Validation of the LEAR appointment: General requirements and principles

In parallel with the legal entity validation, the Central Validation Service will contact the participants to appoint their Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR), i.e. the single point of contact needed for the Participant Register and Funding & Tenders Portal electronic exchange system.

4) The appointment of the LEAR in the Participant Register is mandatory for all validated participants. Without LEAR it will NOT be possible to update the legal entity data in the Participant Register, nor sign contracts electronically in the Funding & Tenders Portal.
