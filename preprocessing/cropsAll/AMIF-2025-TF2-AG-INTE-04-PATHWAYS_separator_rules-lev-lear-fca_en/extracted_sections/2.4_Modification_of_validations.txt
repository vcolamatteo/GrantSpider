2.4 Modification of validations
Modifications in the validation can be made in the following cases:
− following a request submitted by the participant to update the validation (e.g.
in case of changes in the participant’s legal situation such as change of
identity/legal form, name, address, status) or
− after checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out by the EU services
which necessitate a correction.
