3.3 LEAR replacement
A LEAR replacement is equivalent to a new LEAR appointment. For the replacement of
an already validated LEAR, participants must submit the same type of documents and
the Central Validation Service will follow the procedure for the validation of LEAR
appointment (see above).
3.4 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant did not respect the obligation to keep the original
documents or committed other irregularities, appropriate measures will be taken.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants, procurements, or
contribution agreements, their participation may be terminated and undue amounts
paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 146 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
4. Financial capacity assessment
4.1 Financial capacity assessment: Criteria and conditions
In addition to the legal entity validation and LEAR appointment, the Central Validation
Service also assists the EU services with the financial capacity assessment (required
by the Financial Regulation for grants and procurements; not needed for prizes or
contribution agreements).
