4.3 Duration of validity and renewal
The financial assessment is valid for 18 months after the closure date of the most
recent assessed accounting period. If during this period the participant applies for
another grant or tender, the financial documents will not be requested again.
However, if there are justified grounds to doubt the financial capacity, a new
assessment may be triggered even before the end of the 18 months.
4.4 Modification of the assessment
In case of disagreement with the assessment, the participant may contact the Central
Validation Service by sending additional justifications via Participant Register
message. The subject of the message should be clearly labelled as related to the
financial assessment (not PIC validation, LEAR assessment or other).
The Central Validation Service will carry out a re-assessment on the basis of the
additional documents.
4.5 Ex-post verifications carried out by the EU — Irregularities and/or false
declarations
The EU services reserve the right to carry out — at any moment — checks, reviews,
audits or investigations.
If it is found out that a participant made false declarations, their status may be
changed.
If in the meantime the participant already received EU grants or procurements, their
participation may be terminated and undue amounts paid will be recovered.
In case of irregularities or false declarations, participants may moreover be fined and
excluded from future EU funding (grants, procurements, prizes, contribution
agreements, etc; see Articles 135 to 145 of the Financial Regulation).
In addition, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may be informed.
